                Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services

                to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance
                Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information
                Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions
                would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services.
                You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the
